# Task – File Handling and CSV Operations in Python

This project demonstrates how to work with text files and CSV files in Python using built-in file handling and the csv module.

## Overview
The program creates and manages a text file to store user data and a CSV file to store structured student records.  
It covers writing, reading, appending data, handling file exceptions, and properly closing files.

## Features
- Create and write data to a text (TXT) file
- Read and append data to the text file
- Handle file-related exceptions safely
- Create a CSV file using the csv module
- Write multiple rows to the CSV file
- Read and display CSV file contents
- Ensure proper file closing using the with statement

## Files Included
- `file_handling_demo.py` – Main Python script
- `users.txt` – Text file generated by the program
- `students.csv` – CSV file generated by the program

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal in the project directory
2. Run the script:
python file_handling_demo.py
3. Follow the input prompts
4. Check the generated TXT and CSV files in the same folder

## Concepts Covered
- File handling modes (`r`, `w`, `a`)
- Exception handling (`try-except`)
- CSV file operations
- Writing and reading structured data
- Resource management using `with`

## Outcome
This project provides hands-on experience with Python file handling and CSV processing, which are widely used in real-world applications such as data storage, reporting, and data exchange.
