# Task – Python Collections Demonstration

This project demonstrates the use of Python collections such as lists, tuples, and sets through a structured example.

# Concepts Covered
- Storing and manipulating data using lists
- Adding, removing, and sorting list elements
- Using tuples for fixed (immutable) data
- Removing duplicates using sets
- Performing set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- Iterating over collections
- Comparing mutable and immutable data types
- Printing formatted output

# File Included
- `collections_demo.py`

# How to Run
1. Open a terminal in the project directory
2. Run the command:
python collections_demo.py
3. View the formatted output in the terminal

# Outcome
The program clearly demonstrates Python collection behaviors and best practices in a readable and organized way.
