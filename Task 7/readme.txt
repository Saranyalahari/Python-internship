# Task – Student Records Management using Dictionary & JSON

This project demonstrates how to manage student records in Python using dictionaries and JSON for data storage and retrieval.

## Overview
The program stores student details such as name, course, department, marks, and attendance using a dictionary.  
It performs common operations like accessing, updating, deleting records, converting data to JSON, saving it to a file, and reading it back into Python.

## Features
- Store student details using nested dictionaries
- Access dictionary keys and values
- Update and delete student records
- Loop through dictionary to generate student reports
- Convert Python dictionary to JSON format
- Save JSON data to a file
- Read JSON file back into Python
- Display clean, formatted output
- Simulates a real-world student record system

## Files Included
- `student_records.py` – Main Python script
- `student_records.json` – JSON file generated by the program

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal in the project directory
2. Run the script:
python student_records.py
3. View the output in the terminal
4. Check the generated `student_records.json` file in the same directory

## Sample Output
- Displays initial student records
- Shows updated records after modification
- Prints detailed student reports
- Confirms JSON file creation
- Reads and displays data from JSON file

## Concepts Covered
- Dictionaries and nested dictionaries
- Accessing, updating, and deleting dictionary data
- Looping through dictionaries
- JSON serialization and deserialization
- File handling in Python
- Clean and formatted output using f-strings

## Outcome
This project provides hands-on experience with Python data structures and JSON handling, which are commonly used in real-world applications such as student management systems and backend services.
